###Moses' idea for a garage sensor
- take a walk around the shop and think about where this device might be useful. CNC router in the woodshop is a good place to start.

###This tutorial expands on our previous experiment featuring the PIR Motion sensor.
- We are going to begin adding multiple features to our devices so this is a nice easy way to get started. This tutorial also utilizes TinkerCad for creating
your own arduino wiring diagrams.
